# Contributing

Contributions to `qcoder` whether in the form of bug fixes, issue reports, new
code or documentation improvement are welcome. Please use the github issue
tracker. For any pull request please link to or open a corresponding issue in the
issue tracker. Please ensure that you have notifications turned on and respond to
questions, comments or needed changes promptly.

In making contributions and suggestions please keep in mind the general approach
and road map outlined below as well as the motivation for qcoder. The intent
of this project is not to replace a full featured proprietary QDA application.
In our view, the advantage of open source is that, instead, qcoder can offer
the distinctive features of qualitative coding while providing ways to 
interact with other R packages that implement specific analytical techniques.
In deciding whether to implement specific features we will always first
ask whether it would be possible to interact with (or possibly help to build)
a separate R package. Our main focus is on coding and providing ways to
interact with other packages, not analysis.

Our approach is currently highly focused on ease of use for 
people who have not used R previously and who have possibly 
not used QDA software at all.  Therefore
we have made the decision to first focus on a simple, tightly structured 
project model that does not require the installation of Java or of a data base.

Once we have a satisfactory interface there are a number of extensions that
we will make that will allow more flexibility and power and hence support 
larger and more complex projects and users with more experience.  These will
include more flexiblity on the location of files (including the ability to
use text accessible on the Web) and storage in a data base. Therefore, all
code contributions should be made with this future in mind.  Functions should
work from the command line, which also ensures that they can be efficiently
tested. We welcome interested people, both users and developers, to discuss
these plans in our issue tracker and help make them happen.

If you would like to make a code or documentation contribution, please open
an issue in the tracker that you link to a pull request.
